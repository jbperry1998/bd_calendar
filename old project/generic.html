									<h3>Why did we start HooCooks?</h3>
									<p>We saw the need to teach college students 
										not just how to cook, but how to budget,
										 groceryshop, and create a balanced diet all on their own.</p>

									<h4>James Perry (co-founder)</h4>
									<blockquote>"We just wanted to show our peers that, like they say in Ratatouille, anyone can cook. Not only can anyone cook, but cooking for yourself can actually be a cheaper and healthier option than most people realize."</blockquote>

										<h3>Where did we come from?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The three of us met in an E-Commerce class where we worked on this project. We saw a need and decided to try and fill that need by creating a service for our peers. </p>

									<h3><i> Not Your Average Meal Plan</i></h3>
									<p>We wanted to give students a healthy and cheap alternative to the normal meal plans that are available to them and show them that when you are organized and knowledgible, cooking can be fun. </p>
